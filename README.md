# Catch-The-Cheese

Here is the current build of Catch the Cheese.  Please watch this repository if you'd like to be notified as I release versions.

28/02/2021:
There is now a leaderboard for you to comepte with each other! Currently it just tracks the number of levels completed, but will be expanded in the future.
The build has also been tightened up so it is now a much smaller download. The non weapon items have been removed for the time being, but will be back in the next release.

Notes:

- space to jump
- q to attack
- tab to change weapon
- arrows for movement
