20/03/2021:
Spike levels will appear after 5 successful room clears!

19/03/2021:
New enemy type, fixed graphical bug with health bars. The difficulty now ramps as you play to give you time to get into each game.

18/03/2021:
Minor update to explosions to include a small knockback. Traps have also had their damage halved.

14/03/2021:
There is now a login system that will make tracking stats more secure, and a better leaderboard for showing the results.

10/03/2021:
Functionality is now fully back to pick up items as you play which allows you to replenish ammo supplies. Can also pick up accessories such as the cheese grater for extra armour, and traps can now be dropped.

28/02/2021:
There is now a leaderboard for you to comepte with each other! Currently it just tracks the number of levels completed, but will be expanded in the future.
The build has also been tightened up so it is now a much smaller download. The non weapon items have been removed for the time being, but will be back in the next release.
